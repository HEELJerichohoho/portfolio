    Who's Jericho? I am an IT student that aims to be adept in programming and its other aspects. I can say that I have a beginner 
    knowledge in Java language. I am still learning and I will do whatever it takes to learn more about it since I am fascinated by it.
  </p>

    Other than programming, I consider myself an avid gamer because I started to play video games since I was a child and 
    I have spent a ginormous amount of money on gaming. Horizon Zero Dawn, GTA series, and Red Dead Redemption 2 are my favorite games of all time.
    I also write poetry sometimes and I read a lot of books, with "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown being my favorite book.
