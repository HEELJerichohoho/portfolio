  <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>

  <p>
    Outside of work and programming, I consider myself an avid gamer because I started to play video games since I was a child and 
    I have spent a ginormous amount of money on gaming. Horizon Zero Dawn, GTA series, and Red Dead Redemption 2 are my favorite games of all time.
    I also write poetry sometimes and I read a lot of books, with "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown being my favorite book.
